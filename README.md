========================

Building a better solution for measuring and comparing results for an excellent Science Olympiad event: Bungee Drop

Definition of the Problem:
The Science Olympiad event Bungee Drop is excellent in spirit, but difficult to scientifically execute. the essential idea is that a team will drop a weight a defined distance, attached to an elastic cord of their own design. In this competition, teams that are able to drop the weight/cord and get closest to a bottom surface without touching the surface will win. The nature of determining exactly which team was "closest to a bottom surface without touching" has proven to be quite difficult. 

Intended Solution:
The motion of a falling object should be something that is a silly measurable with an ultrasonic range finder. "The bottom surface" can be liberally interpreted to include a 2-D plane, as defined by a laser level arranged A fixed distance above an ultrasonic range finder. From this set-up, some code in Python and for Arun could be written o track he motion of the falling object, the minimum distance above the bottom surface, and to visualize and log this data for further review by students or tournament supervisors.

Action Plan Following Completion:
Once this project is completed, the results will be used and explained to the Science Olympiad Bungee Drop national event supervisor for review. Due to the capitalization of this project in the ambiguity of the term "the bottom surface" the entire project Will need to be reviewed. If the project results are determined to be appropriate, they I'll hopefully become the new recommended measurement method for all Bungee Drop competitions.

Thanks for all the help!
